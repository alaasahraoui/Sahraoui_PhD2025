abstract = {More than two decades of research have demonstrated an increasing need for software systems to be self-adaptive. Self-adaptation manages runtime dynamics, which are difficult to predict before deployment. A vast body of knowledge to develop Self-Adaptive Software Systems (SASS) has been established. However, we discovered a lack of process support to develop self-adaptive systems with reuse. The lack of process support may hinder knowledge transfer and quality design. To that end, we propose a domain-engineering based methodology, Autonomic Software Product Lines engineering (ASPLe), which provides step-by-step guidelines for developing families of SASS with systematic reuse. The evaluation results from a case study show positive effects on quality and reuse for self-adaptive systems designed using the ASPLe compared to state-of-the-art engineering practices.}

Rather than contributing a  specific set of gestures, we contribute a set of gesture types, which together make a set of the core actions needed to complete any of our six chosen tasks in the domain of human-to-human gestural communication without the speech channel. We observed 12 participants, cooperating to accomplish different tasks only using hand gestures to communicate. We analyzed 5,500 gestures in terms of hand usage and gesture type, using a novel classification scheme which combines three existing taxonomies in order to better capture this interaction space. Our findings indicate that, depending on the meaning of the gesture, there is preference in the usage of gesture types, such as pointing, pantomimic acting, direct manipulation, semaphoric, or iconic gestures. These results can be used as guidelines to design purely gesture driven interfaces for interactive environments and surfaces.}

Therefore, there is a need to assess the usability of those generated user interfaces, either taken in isolation or compared to each other. This paper describes an MDE approach that generates multi-platform graphical user interfaces (e.g., desktop, web) that will be subject to an exploratory controlled experiment. The usability of user interfaces generated for the two mentioned platforms and used on multiple display devices (i.e., standard size, large, and small screens) has been examined in terms of satisfaction, effectiveness and efficiency. An experiment with a factorial design for repeated measures was conducted for 31 participants, i.e., postgraduate students and professors selected by convenience sampling. The data were collected with the help of questionnaires and forms and were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric tests such as ANOVA with repeated measures and Friedman's test, respectively. Efficiency was significantly better in large screens than in small ones as well as in the desktop platform rather than in the web platform, with a confidence level of 95\%. The experiment also suggests that satisfaction tends to be better in standard size screens than in small ones. The results suggest that the tested MDE approach should incorporate enhancements in its multi-device/platform user interface generation process in order to improve its generated usability.},

In particular, we argue that there are human aspects of context that cannot be sensed or even inferred by technological means, so context-aware systems cannot be designed simply to act on our behalf. Rather, they will have to be able to defer to users in an efficient and non-obtrusive fashion. Our point is particularly relevant for systems that are constructed such that applications are architecturally isolated from the sensing and inferencing that governs their behavior. We propose a design framework that is intended to guide thinking about accommodating human aspects of context. This framework presents four design principles that support intelligibility of system behavior and accountability of human users, and a number of human-salient details of context that must be accounted for in context-aware system design.},

This requires powerful interaction models, a better understanding of both the sensory-motor details of interaction and a broader view of interaction in the context of use. It also requires novel interaction architectures that address reinterpretability, resilience and scalability.},

We introduce Generative Theories of Interaction, which draw insights from empirical theories about human behavior in order to define specific concepts and actionable principles, which, in turn, serve as guidelines for analyzing, critiquing, and constructing new technological artifacts. After introducing and defining Generative Theories of Interaction, we present three detailed examples from our own work: Instrumental Interaction, Human–Computer Partnerships, and Communities \& Common Objects. Each example describes the underlying scientific theory and how we derived and applied HCI-relevant concepts and principles to the design of innovative interactive technologies. Summary tables offer sample questions that help analyze existing technology with respect to a specific theory, critique both positive and negative aspects, and inspire new ideas for constructing novel interactive systems.},

This separation enables managing guidelines (i.e., create, retrieve, update, and delete) without affecting the code of the evaluation engine. The evaluation engine is coupled to a reporting system that automatically generates one or many evaluation reports in a flexible way: adaptation for screen reading or for a printed report, sorting by page, by object, by guideline, by priority, or by severity of the detected problems. This paper focuses on the reporting system.}

	abstract     = {In order to reduce the inevitable end user disruption and cognitive perturbation induced by adapting a graphical user interface, the results of the adaptation could be conveyed to the end user by animating a transition scenario showing the evolution from the user interface before adaptation to the user interface after adaptation. A transition scenario consists of a sequence of adaptation operations (e.g., set/change a property of a widget, replace a widget by another, resize a widget) belonging to a catalogue of operations defined as an Extended Backus-Naur Form grammar. Each transition operation has a range from a single widget (e.g., this Ok button) to a selection of widgets based on a selector mechanism (e.g., all validation widgets of this family of interfaces). A transition scenario is built either automatically by any adaptation algorithm or interactively by a specific editor for designers. An animator then executes the animation scenario by parsing each adaptation operation one by one or in a grouped mode and by rendering them by an animated transition on a user interface model. The type (e.g., wipe, box in, box out) and parameters (e.g., animation speed, pace, direction) of each animated transition have been selected based on usability guidelines for animation. A user study suggests that a transition scenario reinforces understandability and trust, while still suffering from lag.},

The text helps students understand software development techniques and processes at a reasonably sophisticated level. Students acquire practical experience through team software projects. Throughout much of the book, a relatively large project is used to teach about the requirements, design, and coding of software. In addition, a continuing case study of an agile software development project offers a complete picture of how a successful agile project can work. The book covers each major phase of the software development life cycle, from developing software requirements to software maintenance. It also discusses project management and explains how to read software engineering literature. Three appendices describe software patents, command-line arguments, and flowcharts.}

Utilizing a single stereo camera and voice assistant, LUI does not require calibration or many sensors to operate, and it can be easily installed and deployed.

abstract = {One of the main benefits of model-driven development of User Interfaces (UIs) is the increase in efficiency and consistency when developing multiple variants of a UI. For instance, multiple UIs for different target users, platforms, devices, or for whole product families can be generated from the same abstract models. However, purely generated UIs are not always sufficient as there is often need for customizing the individual UI variants, e.g., due to usability issues or specific customer requirements.In this paper we present a model-driven approach for the development of UI families with systematic support for customizations. The approach supports customizing all aspects of a UI (UI elements, screens, navigation, etc.) and storing the customizations in specific models. As a result, a UI family can be evolved more efficiently because individual UI variants can be re-generated (after some changes have been applied to the family) without losing any previously made customizations. We demonstrate this by thirty highly customized real-world products from a commercial family of web information systems called HIS-GX/QIS.},

Dramatic opportunities exist to develop direct manipulation programming to create end-user programming tools, dynamic queries to perform information search in large databases, and information visualization to support network database browsing. Direct manipulation depends on visual representation of the objects and actions of interest, physical actions or pointing instead of complex syntax, and rapid incremental reversible operations whose effect on the object of interest is immediately visible. This strategy can lead to user interfaces that are comprehensible, predictable and controllable. Direct manipulation interfaces are seen as more likely candidates to influence advanced user interfaces than adaptive, autonomous, intelligent agents. User control and responsibility are highly desirable.},

Instead of restricting adaptivity to this format, adaptivity could be ensured by exploiting the entire display space available in full-screen or intermediate-screen mode. Inspired by fractal geometry, we motivate and define the concept of a fractal adaptive menu, a graphical adaptive menu that benefits from three properties useful for adaptivity: self-similarity, recursive navigation, and hierarchical menu organization. We explain how to engineer this menu for graphical user interfaces and validate this approach with a case study in machine control for a steel mill. In addition to being adaptive to the screen resolution, a fractal adaptive menu is particularly beneficial when menu navigation is repetitive or frequent in a deep hierarchical organization. Proprioceptive memory can make it easier to remember which menu areas to select during a long crossing of the hierarchy.},

To facilitate this development, we present QuantumLeap, a framework for engineering gestural user interfaces based on the Leap Motion Controller. Its pipeline software architecture can be parameterized to define a workflow among modules for acquiring gestures from the Leap Motion Controller, for segmenting them, recognizing them, and managing their mapping to functions of the application. To demonstrate its practical usage, we implement two gesture-based applications: an image viewer that allows healthcare workers to browse DICOM medical images of their patients without any hygiene issues commonly associated with touch user interfaces and a large-scale application for managing multimedia contents on wall screens. To evaluate the usability of QuantumLeap, seven participants took part in an experiment in which they used QuantumLeap to add a gestural interface to an existing application.},

	abstract     = {Microwave radars bring many benefits to mid-air gesture sensing due to their large field of view and independence from environmental conditions, such as ambient light and occlusion. However, radar signals are highly dimensional and usually require complex deep learning approaches. To understand this landscape, we report results from a systematic literature review of (N=118) scientific papers on radar sensing, unveiling a large variety of radar technology of different operating frequencies and bandwidths and antenna configurations but also various gesture recognition techniques. Although highly accurate, these techniques require a large amount of training data that depend on the type of radar. Therefore, the training results cannot be easily transferred to other radars. To address this aspect, we introduce a new gesture recognition pipeline that implements advanced full-wave electromagnetic modeling and inversion to retrieve physical characteristics of gestures that are radar independent, i.e., independent of the source, antennas, and radar-hand interactions. Inversion of radar signals further reduces the size of the dataset by several orders of magnitude, while preserving the essential information. This approach is compatible with conventional gesture recognizers, such as those based on template matching, which only need a few training examples to deliver high recognition accuracy rates. To evaluate our gesture recognition pipeline, we conducted user-dependent and user-independent evaluations on a dataset of 16 gesture types collected with the Walabot, a low-cost off-the-shelf array radar. We contrast these results with those obtained for the same gesture types collected with an ultra-wideband radar made of a vector network analyzer with a single horn antenna and with a computer vision sensor, respectively. Based on our findings, we suggest some design implications to support future development in radar-based gesture recognition.},

This approach consists of four steps: business process modeling in the context of organizational engineering, task model derivation from the business process model, task refinement, and user interface model derivation from the task model. Each step contributes to specify and refine mappings between the source and the target model. In this way, each model modification could be adequately propagated in the rest of the chain. By applying this model-driven approach, the user interfaces of the information systems are directly meeting the requirements of the business processes and are no longer decoupled from them. This approach has been validated on a case study in a large bank-insurance company.},

To begin to solve this problem, we describe a small suite of accessible techniques that we collectively refer to as the Jackknife gesture recognizer. Our dynamic time warping based approach for both segmented and continuous data is designed to be a robust, go-to method for gesture recognition across a variety of modalities using only limited training samples. We evaluate pen and touch, Wii Remote, Kinect, Leap Motion, and sound-sensed gesture datasets as well as conduct tests with continuous data. Across all scenarios we show that our approach is able to achieve high accuracy, suggesting that Jackknife is a capable recognizer and good first choice for many endeavors.},

In this paper, we present an approach in which task models are used throughout the design and development cycle up to the final application.

To eliminate this expensive preprocessing, this paper introduces a vector-between-vectors recognition where a gesture is defined by a vector based on geometric algebra and performs recognition by computing a novel Local Shape Distance (LSD) between vectors. We mathematically prove the LSD position, scale, and rotation invariance, thus eliminating the preprocessing. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we instantiate LSD for n=2 to compare !FTL, a 2D stroke-gesture recognizer with respect to $1 and $P, two state-of-the-art gesture recognizers, on a gesture set typically used for benchmarking. !FTL benefits from a recognition rate similar to $P, but a significant smaller execution time and a lower algorithmic complexity.},

These gestures are sensed, modeled, recognized, and interpreted by interactive computer systems to leverage the rich expressiveness of human communicative skills and, consequently, enable natural, intuitive, and fluent means of communication for users in relation to a computer interlocutor. This chapter presents multiple aspects relevant to the design and engineering of gesture-based interaction, including desirable quality properties of gesture input, gesture representation and recognition techniques, gesture analysis methods, and corresponding software tools to assist the design of gesture sets for interactive systems and accessibility aspects of gesture interaction for users with various sensory or motor abilities. Also, this chapter is meant to provide an overview of the large scientific literature available on the topic of gesture-based interaction, pointing the reader to both theoretical and practical aspects and highlighting design challenges, technical solutions, and opportunities for designing and engineering gesture-based interaction with computer systems.}

A substantial body of knowledge is available on this topic, among which gesture elicitation studies stand out distinctively. In these studies, end users are invited to propose gestures for specific referents, which are the functions to control for an interactive system. The vast majority of gesture elicitation studies conclude with a consensus gesture set identified following a process of consensus or agreement analysis. However, the information about specific gesture sets determined for specific applications is scattered across a wide landscape of disconnected scientific publications, which poses challenges to researchers and practitioners to effectively harness this body of knowledge. To address this challenge, we conducted a systematic literature review and examined a corpus of N= 267 studies encompassing a total of 187,265 gestures elicited from 6,659 participants for 4,106 referents. To understand similarities in users’ gesture preferences within this extensive dataset, we analyzed a sample of 2,304 gestures extracted from the studies identified in our literature review. Our approach consisted of (i) identifying the context of use represented by end users, devices, platforms, and gesture sensing technology; (ii) categorizing the referents; (iii) classifying the gestures elicited for those referents; and (iv) cataloging the gestures based on their representation and implementation modalities. Drawing from the findings of this review, we propose guidelines for conducting future end-user gesture elicitation studies.},

	abstract     = {Background With the development of today’s technology, and as humans tend to naturally use hand gestures in their communication process to clarify their intentions, hand gesture recognition is considered to be an important part of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), which gives computers the ability of capturing and interpreting hand gestures, and executing commands afterwards. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic literature review for identifying the most prominent techniques, applications and challenges in hand gesture recognition. Methodology To conduct this systematic review, we have screened 560 papers retrieved from IEEE Explore published from the year 2016 to 2018, in the searching process keywords such as “hand gesture recognition” and “hand gesture techniques” have been used. However, to focus the scope of the study 465 papers have been excluded. Only the most relevant hand gesture recognition works to the research questions, and the well-organized papers have been studied. Results The results of this paper can be summarized as the following; the surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors with wearable hand gesture devices were the most acquisition tool used in the work studied, also Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was the most applied classifier, the most popular application was using hand gestures for sign language, the dominant environmental surrounding factor that affected the accuracy was the background color, and finally the problem of overfitting in the datasets was highly experienced. Conclusions The paper will discuss the gesture acquisition methods, the feature extraction process, the classification of hand gestures, the applications that were recently proposed, the challenges that face researchers in the hand gesture recognition process, and the future of hand gesture recognition. We shall also introduce the most recent research from the year 2016 to the year 2018 in the field of hand gesture recognition for the first time.}
